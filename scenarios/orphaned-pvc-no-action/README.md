# Scenario #122: Orphaned PVC — LLM Judgment & Human-in-the-Loop

## Overview

Orphaned PVCs from completed batch jobs trigger a `KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned`
alert. The `cleanup-pvc-v1` workflow **is present** in the catalog — this scenario
deliberately tests the LLM's judgment when a technically matching workflow exists but
the situation may not warrant automated intervention.

The LLM's behavior is non-deterministic, yielding three valid outcomes:

| Path | LLM Decision | Warnings | Outcome |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **A** | No workflow selected (empty `workflowId`) | None | `NoActionRequired` or `ManualReviewRequired` — auto-completes |
| **B** | Selects `CleanupPVC` + warns "no remediation warranted" | `["Alert not actionable — no remediation warranted"]` | `AwaitingApproval` — human review gate |
| **C** | Selects `CleanupPVC`, no warnings | None | `Remediated` — PVCs cleaned up |

All three paths are correct. Path A reflects the LLM's judgment that no action is
needed; on v1.2+ the AA phase may be `Failed` and the RR outcome `ManualReviewRequired`
when no workflow is selected (instead of `NoActionRequired` on v1.1).
Path B shows the LLM hedging — it identifies a matching workflow but raises a
warning that the situation is benign housekeeping; the warning-aware Rego policy
(`has_warnings`) catches this and forces human review. Path C shows the LLM confidently
selecting the cleanup workflow — orphaned PVCs from completed batch jobs are a valid
cleanup target, and the LLM proceeds without hesitation.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Signal** | `KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned` — >3 bound PVCs in namespace for >3 min |
| **Severity** | `warning` / root cause severity `low` |

## Signal Flow

```
Batch jobs complete → PVCs remain (orphaned) → kube-state-metrics
→ Prometheus (count bound PVCs > 3 for 3m) → AlertManager
→ Gateway webhook → RR created → SP → AA (HAPI/LLM)
→ Path A: NoActionRequired (auto-complete)
→ Path B: CleanupPVC selected + warning → Rego llm_warns_no_remediation → AwaitingApproval
→ Path C: CleanupPVC selected, no warnings → WFE → Remediated
```

## Warning-Aware Rego Policy

The default shipping Rego policy only gates on `is_production`. It does not inspect
`input.warnings`. This means Path B would auto-execute the `CleanupPVC` workflow in
non-production environments without human review — the LLM's warning is silently
ignored.

The custom `rego/approval-warnings.rego` adds targeted and catch-all rules:

```rego
llm_warns_no_remediation if {
    some w in input.warnings
    contains(w, "no remediation warranted")
}

require_approval if { llm_warns_no_remediation }
require_approval if { has_warnings }

risk_factors contains {"score": 80, "reason": "LLM warning: no remediation warranted"} if {
    llm_warns_no_remediation
}
risk_factors contains {"score": 75, "reason": "LLM raised warnings — human review recommended"} if {
    has_warnings
    not llm_warns_no_remediation
}
```

With these rules:
- **Staging/dev namespaces**: approval required only when LLM raises warnings;
  without warnings, the pipeline auto-approves as before.
- **"no remediation warranted" signal** (score 80): the specific warning string
  from the LLM gets the highest score and a targeted reason.
- **Production namespaces**: approval already required by `is_production` (score 40);
  warnings raise the score to 80 so the reason reflects the warning, not the
  environment.

> **Issue**: [kubernaut#439](https://github.com/jordigilh/kubernaut/issues/439) tracks
> adding this rule to the default Helm chart Rego.

## LLM Analysis (Path B — observed)

The LLM selects `CleanupPVC` with 90% confidence but simultaneously warns:

> *"Alert not actionable — no remediation warranted"*

Root cause analysis:
- **Summary**: Orphaned PVCs from completed batch jobs consuming unnecessary storage
  resources. No impact on running workloads.
- **Severity**: `low`
- **Contributing factors**: Completed batch jobs, Missing automatic PVC cleanup,
  Independent PVC lifecycle

The `data-processor` deployment is healthy — the orphaned PVCs are leftover storage,
not a service-impacting issue.

## Why Staging?

The scenario runs in a **staging** namespace to isolate the `has_warnings` approval
mechanism. In a production namespace, the default `is_production` rule would always
require approval regardless of warnings — you'd never know whether approval was
triggered by the environment or by the LLM warning.

In staging, the default policy auto-approves everything. Only the custom
`llm_warns_no_remediation` rule can trigger the approval gate, proving the Rego catches
LLM ambivalence independently of the environment guard.

## Prerequisites

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cluster | Kind or OCP with Kubernaut services |
| LLM backend | Real LLM (not mock) via HAPI |
| Prometheus | With kube-state-metrics |
| StorageClass | `standard` (Kind) or cluster default (OCP) |
| Workflow catalog | `cleanup-pvc-v1` present (shipped with demo content) |
| Rego policy | Warning-aware rule (`llm_warns_no_remediation`) — applied by `run.sh` |

### Workflow RBAC

This scenario's remediation workflow runs under a dedicated ServiceAccount with
scoped permissions (created automatically when workflows are seeded via
`platform-helper.sh`):

| Resource | Name |
|----------|------|
| ServiceAccount | `cleanup-pvc-v1-runner` (in `kubernaut-workflows`) |
| ClusterRole | `cleanup-pvc-v1-runner` |
| ClusterRoleBinding | `cleanup-pvc-v1-runner` |

**Permissions**:

| API group | Resources | Verbs |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| core | persistentvolumeclaims | get, list, delete |
| core | pods | get, list |

## Running the Scenario

> [!TIP]
> **OCP users**: This walkthrough defaults to Kind. Look for the **OCP** dropdowns
> on steps that differ. For automated runs, prefix with `export PLATFORM=ocp`.
>
> **Time estimate**: ~10 min (Kind) · ~15 min (OCP)

### Automated Run

```bash
./scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/run.sh
```

Options:
- `--interactive` — pause at approval gate for manual approve/reject
- `--no-validate` — skip the automated validation pipeline

```bash
export PLATFORM=ocp
./scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/run.sh
```

</details>

### Manual Step-by-Step

#### 1. Patch approval policy with warning-aware Rego (backs up current policy)

```bash
kubectl get configmap aianalysis-policies -n kubernaut-system \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.approval\.rego}' > /tmp/approval-rego-backup
kubectl patch configmap aianalysis-policies -n kubernaut-system --type=merge \
  -p "{\"data\":{\"approval.rego\":$(cat scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/rego/approval-warnings.rego | jq -Rs .)}}"
kubectl rollout restart deployment/aianalysis-controller -n kubernaut-system
kubectl rollout status deployment/aianalysis-controller -n kubernaut-system --timeout=60s
```

#### 2. Deploy (base manifests use staging; overlays/ocp for OpenShift)

```bash
kubectl apply -k scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/manifests
```

<details>
<summary><strong>OCP</strong></summary>

```bash
kubectl apply -k scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/overlays/ocp/
```

</details>

#### 3. Wait for deployment

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deploy/data-processor -n demo-orphaned-pvc --timeout=120s
```

#### 4. Inject orphaned PVCs

```bash
bash scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/inject-orphan-pvcs.sh
```

<details>
<summary><strong>OCP</strong></summary>

```bash
PLATFORM=ocp bash scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/inject-orphan-pvcs.sh
```

</details>

#### 5. Wait for alert (~3 min `for:` duration)

> [!NOTE]
> **OCP timing**: Alerts may take 3-5 minutes to fire on OCP (vs ~2 min on Kind)
> due to the default 30s kube-state-metrics scrape interval and Alertmanager
> group_wait settings.

```bash
kubectl exec -n monitoring alertmanager-kube-prometheus-stack-alertmanager-0 -c alertmanager -- \
  amtool alert query alertname=KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093
```

<details>
<summary><strong>OCP (amtool)</strong></summary>

```bash
kubectl exec -n openshift-monitoring alertmanager-main-0 -- \
  amtool alert query alertname=KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093
```

</details>

#### 6. Monitor pipeline

```bash
watch kubectl get rr,sp,aia,wfe,ea,notif -n kubernaut-system
```

#### 7. Inspect AI Analysis

```bash
# Get the latest AIA resource
AIA=$(kubectl get aia -n kubernaut-system -o name --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -1)

# Root cause analysis: summary, severity, and remediation target
kubectl get $AIA -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='
Root Cause:  {.status.rootCauseAnalysis.summary}
Severity:    {.status.rootCauseAnalysis.severity}
Target:      {.status.rootCauseAnalysis.remediationTarget.kind}/{.status.rootCauseAnalysis.remediationTarget.name}
'; echo

# Selected workflow and LLM rationale
kubectl get $AIA -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='
Workflow:    {.status.selectedWorkflow.workflowId}
Confidence:  {.status.selectedWorkflow.confidence}
Rationale:   {.status.selectedWorkflow.rationale}
'; echo

# Alternative workflows considered
kubectl get $AIA -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='{range .status.alternativeWorkflows[*]}  Alt: {.workflowId} (confidence: {.confidence}) -- {.rationale}{"\n"}{end}' # no output if empty

# Approval context and investigation narrative
kubectl get $AIA -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='
Approval:    {.status.approvalRequired}
Reason:      {.status.approvalContext.reason}
Confidence:  {.status.approvalContext.confidenceLevel}
'; echo
kubectl get $AIA -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='{.status.approvalContext.investigationSummary}'; echo
```

#### Expected LLM Reasoning (v1.2 baseline)

When Kubernaut's AI analysis processes this scenario, the LLM typically reasons as follows:

| Field | Expected Value |
|-------|---------------|
| **Root Cause** | Orphaned PVCs from completed batch jobs exist in the namespace. Five PVCs (batch-output-job-1 through batch-output-job-5) remain after their parent Job resources were deleted. The data-processor deployment is unaffected and operating normally. |
| **Severity** | low |
| **Target Resource** | PersistentVolumeClaim/batch-output-job-1 (ns: demo-orphaned-pvc) |
| **Workflow Selected** | cleanup-pvc-v1 |
| **Confidence** | 0.95 |
| **Approval** | not required (auto-approved) |

**Key Reasoning Chain:**

1. Detects KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned alert for five PVCs.
2. Confirms the PVCs belong to completed batch jobs that have been deleted.
3. Verifies the main `data-processor` deployment is unaffected and running normally.
4. Selects `cleanup-pvc-v1` to remove the orphaned PVCs since they are no longer needed.

> **Why this matters**: Shows the LLM correctly distinguishing between PVCs that are actively in use (dangerous to delete) and PVCs orphaned by completed jobs (safe to clean up). The scenario name includes "no-action" because the *deployment* needs no remediation — only the orphaned storage is addressed.

Path outcomes after monitoring:

- **Path A**: RR → Completed (`NoActionRequired`)
- **Path B**: RR → `AwaitingApproval` → reject/approve via RAR patch
- **Path C**: RR → Completed (`Remediated`) — PVCs cleaned up

#### 8. View notifications

```bash
kubectl get notif -n kubernaut-system --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
NOTIF=$(kubectl get notif -n kubernaut-system -o name --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -1)
kubectl get $NOTIF -n kubernaut-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.body}'; echo
```

## Cleanup

```bash
./scenarios/orphaned-pvc-no-action/cleanup.sh
```

## BDD Specification

```gherkin
Feature: Orphaned PVC — LLM judgment with available workflow

  Background:
    Given a cluster with Kubernaut services and a real LLM backend
      And the "cleanup-pvc-v1" workflow is registered in the catalog
      And the warning-aware Rego policy (llm_warns_no_remediation) is active
      And the "data-processor" deployment is running in namespace "demo-orphaned-pvc"

  Scenario: Path A — LLM determines no action needed
    When 5 orphaned PVCs from simulated completed batch jobs are created
      And the KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned alert fires (>3 bound PVCs for 3 min)
    Then the alert flows through Gateway → SP → AA (HAPI)
      And the LLM selects no workflow (empty workflowId)
      And AA phase is Completed or Failed (v1.2: Failed when no workflow matched)
      And RO marks the RR as Completed with outcome NoActionRequired or ManualReviewRequired
      And no WorkflowExecution CRD is created
      And all 5 orphaned PVCs remain in the namespace

  Scenario: Path B — LLM selects workflow but warns (human-in-the-loop)
    When 5 orphaned PVCs from simulated completed batch jobs are created
      And the KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned alert fires (>3 bound PVCs for 3 min)
    Then the alert flows through Gateway → SP → AA (HAPI)
      And the LLM selects CleanupPVC with warnings ["Alert not actionable — no remediation warranted"]
      And Rego policy evaluates llm_warns_no_remediation → require_approval
      And approvalReason is "LLM warning: no remediation warranted"
      And RR transitions to AwaitingApproval
      And a RemediationApprovalRequest is created
      And all 5 orphaned PVCs remain in the namespace (pending human decision)

  Scenario: Path C — LLM selects workflow without warnings (automated cleanup)
    When 5 orphaned PVCs from simulated completed batch jobs are created
      And the KubePersistentVolumeClaimOrphaned alert fires (>3 bound PVCs for 3 min)
    Then the alert flows through Gateway → SP → AA (HAPI)
      And the LLM selects CleanupPVC with no warnings
      And a WorkflowExecution is created and completes
      And RO marks the RR as Completed with outcome Remediated
      And the 5 orphaned PVCs are deleted by the cleanup workflow
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 5 orphaned PVCs are created and bound successfully
- [ ] Alert fires after 3 minutes
- [ ] Path A: RR reaches `Completed` with outcome `NoActionRequired` or `ManualReviewRequired` (v1.2), no WFE, PVCs remain
- [ ] Path B: RR reaches `AwaitingApproval`, reason mentions "no remediation warranted"
- [ ] Path B: `approvalReason` is "LLM warning: no remediation warranted", not "Production environment"
- [ ] Path C: RR reaches `Completed` with outcome `Remediated`, WFE completes, PVCs deleted
- [ ] All three paths are valid — scenario passes if any outcome is observed
