# StatefulSet PVC Failure Demo -- Dispatcher
# Scenario #137: PVC deleted -> pod stuck Pending -> recreate PVC
#
# Usage: ./scenarios/statefulset-pvc-failure/run.sh [--fleet] [--auto-approve|--interactive|--alert-only|--no-validate]
#
# Single cluster (default): runs local/run.sh -- full pipeline against one
# Kubernaut cluster, as documented there.
#
# Fleet mode: set HUB_KUBECONFIG (Kubernaut control plane) and
# SPOKE_KUBECONFIG (demo workload cluster) to run fleet/run.sh instead,
# which deploys the workload on the spoke and always behaves as
# --alert-only (see scripts/fleet-helper.sh).
